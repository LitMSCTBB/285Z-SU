# 285Z Spin Up Code

This is team 285Z's code for the 2022-23 VRC game, Spin Up.
Here's a brief explanation of the most important files you'll *probably* edit.

## `/src/util/INIT.cpp`

This file contains most of our re-used definitions. All of our devices are declared and initialized here (and referenced in `main.h`.)

## `/src/util/AUTONS.cpp`

This file contains all of our autonomous movement. Here, we've created paths to follow for each auton we intend to run.

Other than that, there's not much else to cover. Many of our important files are within `/src/util`, so you can peek around in there to see what's there.
